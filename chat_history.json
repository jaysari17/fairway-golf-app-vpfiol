You want a mobile app called FAIRWAY built with React Native and Expo 54, functioning similarly to Beli but for tracking golf courses. It should include course logging, rating, social features, personalized profiles, discovery, gamification, and user profiles, all with a clean, modern mint-green brand identity.\n\nHere's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Course Logging & Rating:** Implement the core functionality of searching for courses, logging rounds with details (date, course, rating, review, optional score/photos), and a simple rating system. This will form the foundation of the app.\n*   **User Profile:** Create a user profile screen displaying basic information (username, avatar, golf bio, total rounds, total courses) and a map view of played courses.\n*   **Played Courses Library:** Automatically build a \"Played Courses\" library as users log rounds.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: Off-white (#F8F8FF)\n    *   Text: Charcoal gray (#333333)\n    *   TextSecondary: Medium gray (#666666)\n    *   Primary: Deep mint green (#57C8A1)\n    *   Secondary: A slightly darker shade of mint green (#45A088)\n    *   Accent: Dark forest green (#228B22)\n    *   Card: White (#FFFFFF) with soft shadows\n    *   Highlight: A lighter tint of mint green (#70E0C1)\n*   **Typography:**\n    *   Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan for Code Changes:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** If not already done, set up a React Native project with Expo 54.\n2.  **Navigation:** Implement basic tab navigation (using `createBottomTabNavigator` from `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs`) for the main sections: Home (which will initially display the Played Courses library), Log Round, and Profile.\n3.  **Components:** Create reusable components for:\n    *   Course Card: Displays course information (name, location, rating).\n    *   Rating Slider/Emoji Picker: For rating courses.\n    *   Input Fields: For logging round details.\n    *   User Avatar: Displays user's profile picture.\n4.  **Screens:**\n    *   Home Screen: Displays the \"Played Courses\" library in a list format using Course Card components.\n    *   Log Round Screen: A form to search for a course and log round details.\n    *   Profile Screen: Displays user profile information.\n5.  **Data Storage:** For the initial version, use local state management (e.g., `useState` hook) to store logged rounds and user data.\n6.  **Styling:** Apply the specified color palette and UI aesthetic (big white cards, soft shadows, playful animations) using `StyleSheet` from React Native.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-20T16:47:48.859695"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll start by searching the knowledge base for relevant information about icons and navigation patterns, then build the FAIRWAY golf course tracking app."}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me search for available SF Symbols icons for iOS:"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read the current project files to understand the structure:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/_layout.ios.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/profile.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read more files to understand the structure better:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/homeData.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/DemoCard.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/FloatingTabBar.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Perfect!
